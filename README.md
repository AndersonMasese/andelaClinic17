All files in this repository are in answer to Andelabs. The Andelabs site is behaving like the old proctor which was scrapped off
Some of the challenges include not being to test or submit one's code.
This repo contains the fizz buzz lab which is self explanatory, the data structers and car class
the former two are self explanatory but for the car class

please note that for the car class, the kind of functionality to be programmed was inferred fromt hte test class scenarios

I have done to the best of my knowledge,with help from online research.
each functionality has a commented out portion showing where it was gotten from

cheers!
TIA
